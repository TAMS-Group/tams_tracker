# tams_tracker
Low-cost multi-view pose tracking using active markers.

This repository is currently just a placeholder, while the paper
describing the key algorithms is under review. We plan to upload
all software and microcontroller firmware once the paper is 
(hopefully) accepted for publication.

If you are a reviewer and want access to the tracking software,
please contact the paper authors by email.
